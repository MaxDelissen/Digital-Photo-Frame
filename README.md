# Digital-Photo-Frame
This project is a digital photo frame for my grandparents. It automatically displays photos from a shared Google Photos album, requires no interaction beyond powering it on, and connects to Wi-Fi automatically. Designed to be simple, with auto power-off at night to save energy.
